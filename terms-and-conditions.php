                <h5 class="mt-3">Copyrights</h5>
                <p class="">At Seedspire Publishing, we believe in empowering authors by granting full ownership of the
                    content we create. Once the final product is delivered, you retain all rights to the work, allowing
                    you to use it as you see fit.</p>


                <h5 class="mt-3">Payment</h5>
                <p>We require full payment in advance for any services rendered. Clients are also responsible for
                    covering any applicable taxes associated with the payment.</p>


                <h5 class="mt-3">Revisions</h5>
                <p class="mt-3">We offer a 14-day window for revisions, which can be extended if exceptional
                    circumstances arise. The following categories apply to revision turnaround times:</p>

                        <li><strong>24-48 hour urgency: </strong>Revisions will be completed within 48 hours.</li>

                    Project Terms
                </h5>
                <p>Before commencing any project, our team at Seedspire Publishing will have a one-on-one consultation
                    with the client to ensure we understand all requirements. Based on the agreed terms, we will ensure
                    any changes or updates during the project are communicated clearly.</p>


                <h5 class="mt-3">Refund Procedure</h5>
                <p class="mt-3">Refund requests can be made before the work is submitted. Refunds will be processed
                    after deducting transaction fees, which are $150 or 10% of the purchase price, whichever is smaller.
                    Refund requests are not accepted after the work has been submitted.</p>

                <div class="custom-ul ctaul mt-3">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong> Post-purchase refund policy:</strong> No refunds will be issued within 90 days
                            after purchase.</li>

                        <li><strong>No refund after final approval</strong> of the work.</li>



                    </ul>
                </div>


                <p>If you're unsatisfied with the service, you must submit a refund request within 7 days of completing
                    your order. Percentage-based refunds may apply under our revision policies, depending on the
                    circumstances.</p>
